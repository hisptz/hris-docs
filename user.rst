User Administration
*******************

To properly manage the system, there is a need to maintain security by levels. Letting each
user access relevant data and not otherwise. This part of the system is used to define, edit and delete
various system access levels and the users who can access those levels. The following section provides
the way to create these roles and assign each role with what it can access. If one opts for add new, the
following interface occurs

System Roles
============

 The first thing is to create the roles which define what can be done on which data. An example of
 these could be data clerks, data managers, etc. This is so that whoever comes later is only assigned to
 the existing roles.

 It starts with the kind of forms which a person can access in the system. Use the left ← and → right
 arrows to move what you want to. The list below consists of the functionalities that one is allowed to
 do/perform. Again, use arrows to move whatever you want to use.

System Users
============

 After the user role is created, then users who will belong to that role have to be created as well.
 Suppose we created data entry role, then each new user coming is to be allocated which role
 will they take. The following is the interface for the new user registration

 Using options available on the interface you can add new users, edit user details or delete a specific
 user from the system.
