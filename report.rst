Reports are the most important component of any information system. HRHIS allows users to generate various reports from already entered data and export these reports from the system to other formats such as excel or portable document format (pdf) for further manipulation, interpretation or analysis use . 
HRHIS groups reports in six main groups; namely, “Records report” which is basically a report of the list of all records entered by specified user with exception of those whose employment status has been updated to retired, deceased and transferred. 
Secondly is “Aggregated Reports” which as suggested by the name are outputs that aggregate data of fields specified by user. Thirdly, “Completeness Report” which is used to determine the entered number of records in each organization unit against the initial expected value entered for each facility. Fourth, is the “Orgunit reports” these are reports of organization units in specified users account. The organizations units are categorized either by level or by group set.

Fifth, is the “History and training report” which tracks all the history updates of records as have been done for already entered records while training report is for all the In-service trainings updated for each record. Lastly, “Friendly reports” which is a combination of reports for human resource required in Health Plan such as CCHP and CHOP.

.. index:: Records reports

Records reports
===============

There are only three items to select in order to generate this report – the organization unit, which form should the data be included from and if it should use only selected organization unit or with lower levels. If the check box is not selected it will only use data of selected organization unit without the facilities under that unit.
After generating a report, the system will filter the available data and display them according to selected specifications. Note that the results from this report will exclude all entered stuff whose employment status is set to retired, off duty, transferred and deceased.

The aggregated data, in this new release gives the user more ways to explore the data that are in the system already. It allows a user to specify the organization units they want the report for, select the form in which the data will be chosen for report and then select the data to view. These data are in two fields, field one and field two. However, you can also generate this report by selecting only one field and not comparing it to any other field. To do so you have to specify field one and in field to select the option for “use only one field”. This will aggregate only data for field one selected.
