Report Management, is the most important part in many systems. This allows users to generate some
reports from data that has already been entered in the system. From our case, there are three types of
reports that can be generated, “**Record report**” which is basically a report which outputs the list of
required records as specified by the user. Another type of report is “**Aggregated Report**” which
outputs the required aggregated data as specified by user. The third is a group of reports just called
“**other reports**”

Records Reports
===============

 **fig 27: Record Report Generation.**

 There are only two items to select from, where the report is for – the **organization unit** and what
 kind of data to be included – the **form**. These will provide us with the raw data of the records we
 have in the system. There is also a checkbox, very important. If we select a district without this check
 box, we will get data for staff working in the district. If we want records of staff from the health
 facilities as well, we need to click this – check.

 After generating a report, the system will filter the available data and display them according to your
 specifications.

 Below is an example of a record report generated from Mafia District with its lower levels, the
 facilities. Only a part of it is taken to paper sizes

 When the report has been generated, “**Export to EXCEL**” option, found at the lower left corner of
 the screen will enable you to export your report to excel sheet (spreadsheet) for further personal

 Click it and see the results – the spreadsheet

 There is also another option just below it. This is even disaggregating the personnel according to their
 designation. In this way it is easy to track where the shortages are and where the excesses are, if at all
 there are excesses. It produces a spreadsheet as shown in the figure below

Aggregated Reports
==================

 These are the reports where there is no mention of the staff in the records. They help with the
 management of the sector as opposed to the individual staff, and therefore they speak aggregated
 values. The same procedures of generating a record report are used, but in this case you have to select
 Field Option for your aggregated data to be grouped with. For example if you want to generate a
 report based on marital status, you select marital status as your option, and generated report will count
 the data based on their marital status.

 The aggregated data, in this new release gives the user more ways to explore the data that are in the
 system already. It needs a user to specify the organization nit they want the report for, select the form
 in which the data will be chosen for report and then select the data to view. These data are in two
 fields, field one and field two.

Other reports
=============

 These are the reports related to the “History Management” and “In service Training management”.
 The following the 19th figure shows the interface to **other reports**. After selecting an organization
 unit from which to produce report, the user will have to specify which report they want to generate,
 “History management” report or “In service Training” report. If one selects the “In Service Training”
 report they will just have to select the form to use while selecting the “History Management” report,
 there will be a need to select the form to fill in and also, what record from which the history is sought.
