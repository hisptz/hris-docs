The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has initiated development of Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS) with the essence of establishing a national database, to address and strengthen existing information system through coordinating and networking of existing human resource data collection systems. MoHSW consulted a team of experts from department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Dar es Salaam, to take the responsibility of developing, implementing and maintaining HRHIS system in Tanzania Mainland. As for any big system development the process is not an overnight thing. HRHIS is evolving, though with a remarkable speed, the inputs of stakeholders are all‐time required.
This manual outlines the systematic procedures for accessing and using various parts of the system. In case you do not get the assistance you expected from the manual please consult your system administrator or any person authorized to work as the member of the help desk team at your organization.
