Recommendations for Deployment and Implementation
=================================================

Development
-----------
	In the development of the HRIS System the knowledge bases which were used include: 

	1. `Git Source code management <http://git-scm.com/>`_

	2. `Composer <http://getcomposer.org/>`_

	3. `Symfony2 <http://simphony.com>`_

	4. `PHPUnit <http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/index.html>`_

	5. `Doctrine <http://doctrine-project.org>`_

	6. `Twig <http:twig-sensiolabs.org//>`_
		
	7. `{less} - The dynamic stylesheet language <http://lesscss.org>`_

	8. `Internationalization <http://simphony.com/doc/current/book/translation.html>`_


Eclipse Tricks
--------------

	Eclipse is the favoured IDE for HRIS development, followed by PHPStorm, the following are development plugins for eclipse.

	1. `Yedit - Eclipse plugin for YAML Files <http://code.google.com/p/yedit/>`_ from Update site: http://dadacoalition.org/yedit

	2. `Symfony Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/pulse00/Symphony-2-Eclepse-Plugin>`_ from Update site: http://p2.dubture.com or 	   		   `MarketPlace <http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=220368>`_

	3. With those software sources, install plugins from the two sources, that is Composer Json Edit Miscellaneous Phing Symfony Twig 		   YEdit.

	4. `Install PHP Tool Integration for testing <http://phpsrc.org>`_ offers PHPUnit test and Copy/Paste Detector, update site: 		    http://www.phpsrc.org/eclipse/pti/

	5. `Less - Eclipse plugin <http://normalesup.org/~simonet/soft/ow/eclipse-less.fr.html>`_ offers support for less syntax, update 		   site:

Database Development
====================

Co-ordinating and Managing Existing Databases with HRIS
=======================================================

Intergration With Other Systems
===============================
	The HRIS has been integrated with the District Health Information System (DHIS) and is in the process of being integrated with TIIS.

Best Pilot Approach
===================

Trainings
=========
	
Data Utilization Trainings (DUTs)
---------------------------------
	
	Data Utilization Trainings (DUTs) were the trainings which were done to equipe the consumers of the System(HRIS) with the relevant 
	knowledge on HRH management and use.The training are done to the 
	managers at CHMTs, RHMTs, Referal Hospitals and MoHSW HQ on how best they can understand, analyze and use the information collected 		in informing the management of HRH under their capacity.Therefore, conducting of DUTs is meant to enforce effective utilization of 		the HRHIS system as a key source of human resource for health information for planning, development, and decision making mechanism.
	
	The intended participants for DUTs from the CHMT level were the District Medical Officers (DMOs), District Health Secretaries (DHSs), 		and District Nursing Officers (DNOs) and from the RHMT were Regional Medical Officers (RMOs), Regional Health Secretaries (RHSs), and 		Regional Nursing Officers (RNOs). On the other hand, participants from training institutions were Principals, Academic Officers and 		Administrators.
	
	In these trainings UDSM is the leading implementing consultant. The trainings are organized and facilitated by experts from 		**MoHSW/JICA** while **UDSM** and **Intersoft** were providing technical support in showing how get different information and 		report from HRHIS and TIIS applications.

	
Training Modality
*****************
	Data utilization trainings are conducted collaboratively between UDSM, MoHSW/JICA and Intersoft. UDSM is involved in making sure 		the mobile computer laboratory is set where the trainings are organized; stationeries are made available for trainings; and system 		support is given in the cause of the training. Depending on the number of attendants, sometimes it is necessary for UDSM to provide 		one or two experts per session.

Challenges encounter during DUTs
********************************
	Challenges encountered during the DUTs include the number of the Training Laptops not being enoungh in some of the sessions, Venue 		problems, punctuality of the training attendants leading to training starting time delays and limited time for hands on sessions, 		Computer Literacy of the training Participants, POwer Cut-off, some of the required participants sending  representatives who were 		new to the system leading to delays as some of the time had to be used to introduce them to the System before conductind the DUT to 		them, another challenge was the number of the participants being larger than that expected thus leading to the division of the 		training sessions into two and the extension of the the training period.
