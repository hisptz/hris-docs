Reporting a Bug
---------------

	Whenever you find a bug in HRIS, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps us make a better HRIS.	

Reporting a Security Issue
--------------------------

	If you find a security issue in HRIS please do not reveal the issue to the public, report it to the HRIS-Project Team via 		   		`John F. Mukulu <mailto:john.f.mukulu@gmail.com>`_

	For each report, we first try to confirm the vulnerability. When it is confirmed, the Team works on a solution following these steps:

		1. Send an acknowledgement to the reporter;

		2. Work on a patch;

		3. Write a post describing the vulnerability, the possible exploits, and how to patch/upgrade affected applications;

		4. Apply the patch to all maintained versions of HRIS;

		5. Inform the reporter of the Security Issue that the Issue has been resolved:
		
	.. Note::
           While we are working on a patch, please do not reveal the issue publicly.
		


Contribute to Documentation
===========================

	Documentation is as important as code. It follows the exact same principles: DRY, tests, ease of maintenance, extensibility, optimization, 		and refactoring just to name a few. And of course, documentation has bugs, typos, hard to read tutorials, and more.

Contributing
------------

	Before contributing, you need to become familiar with the markup language used by the documentation.

	The HRIS documentation is hosted on GitHub:
