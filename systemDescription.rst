Description Of The System

The main menu displayed upon successful login has the| following:

===============
Form Management
===============
This section deals with the management of the forms and their contents including the
fields through which the form is filled. It is a functionality that is rarely used, as after the
definition of a form a while passes by for data management. It is also advisable, for the
users, not to engage themselves very much with this section

Fields
======

.. _fields_image:
.. figure::  _static/fields.png
   :align:   center

.. centered:: **fig 4: Fields Interface**

This part of the system is used to add, edit and delete database fields which are used to
hold data supplied by the user. Examples of the fields include fname (stands for first
name), lname (stands for last name), etc. The table shown in the above screen shot shows a
specific field, its input type, data type, caption, a mark to show whether it is compulsory or
not, and options to add, edit or delete.

.. note::
 
   For the fields with the combo input type click on the icon in between the “edit” and “delete”
   options to assign more options.

Forms
=====

The interface displayed after clicking the form option looks as follows:

.. _fig5:
.. figure::  _static/forms.png
   :align:   center

.. centered:: **fig 5: Interface for editing the form and adding details**

It displays a list of forms already added into the system. On the right hand side of each
form are the options to edit form details, design the form and assign it the fields you want
and the delete option. On clicking edit, the following screen appears

.. _fig6:

Click the specific field on the left to add it on the form. Use → to add a specific field on the form
and ← to remove the field from the form.

   :align:   center

.. centered:: **fig 7: Interface for designing the form and assigning it the fields you want.**

On the second option, design, the above screen should appear. Put the names of the form
fields you want and for each field assign the database field corresponding to it and then click
on the “Save Form” button to save the form. At any point during the design of the form,
clicking the “Reset” button should instigate clearing.

===============
Data management
===============

This is the part where every day uses of the system depend. It contains the functionalities
which involve the regular management and use of Human Resource data.

Data Entry
==========

 In here you can select the forms designed in the previous part so that you can populate data.

 .. _fig8:
 .. figure::  _static/dataentry.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 8: List of form available for entering data.**

 By clicking on a yellow down arrow, the data entry form for populating data will be opened as
 displayed in the figure below.

 An example of the form ready for data entry is as follows:

 .. _fig9:
 .. figure::  _static/formfordataentry.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 9: Form ready for data entry.**

 Fill the form with the appropriate data then click on the “Save Data” button to submit data to the
 database. There are a few things to notice, though.

 Of these fields there are compulsory ones which need to be filled in for any data entry to be
 successful. The best way for a new user is to put a cursor in each field and read the
 message that pops up as shown in the figure below

 .. _fig10:
 .. figure::  _static/afieldmessage.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 10: A message to describe the data field**

Records
=======

 This option allows you to view the records that you have already entered into the system. If
 records option is selected, it will list available forms, with two options in each form.
 “View All” records and “search” record option.

 .. _fig11:
 .. figure::  _static/records.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 11: View records options**

 If you select search records, the lens‐like button, the system will provide you with a text box to
 enter your search key. The records can be searched using and of the available fields, for instance
 firstname, middle name, surname, employee check number, etc.

 .. _fig12:
 .. figure::  _static/viewrecord.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 12: Search record option**

 On the other hand if View all records options is selected, the system will output all records that has
 already been entered into the database. This is a representation of raw data only.

 .. _fig13:
 .. figure::  _static/recordhistory.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 13: A list of records in the system**

 At the end of each record row, there
 two options: (Edit Record), in case you need to
 update some information of a particular record, then you have to select edit record option,
 and the form will be opened for you to update the selected record.

 Another option is next section.
 which stands for Record’s History Management. This is discussed in the

History Management
==================

 By Selecting History option of a particular record, that record’s history will be displayed as it has
 been added before. The following diagram indicates how history of a particular record is displayed. In
 case there is no history for that particular record, only two options “Add history” and “Back” will be
 displayed for you to add history of that record if any.

 .. _fig14:
 .. figure::  _static/historymanagement.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 14: History Information of a record**

 If **Add History** is selected, a form for adding record’s history will be opened, for you to
 add history.

 .. _fig15:
 .. figure::  _static/addhistory.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 15: Add History**

 In the **history type** one selects whether it is a history related to “Education Level” (if a staff has just
 completed some studies or “Terms of Employment” (for example from volunteering to contractual). It
 depends on what history is to be added.

 After filling in the record, one has to select the “keep this as current record” check box. This will
 change the record of an individual to include the just entered changes.

In Service Training Management
==============================

 This refers to different courses, mostly short courses taken by staff in the institution. This, HRHIS
 training is one of those courses. The following diagram indicates how In service training of a
 particular record is displayed. In case there is no In service training for that particular record, only one
 option “Add New” and “Back” will be displayed for you to add history of that record if any.

Organization Units Management
=============================

 This section of the system has four main parts: Organization Units, orgUnits Groups, OrgUnits group
 sets and Generate Structure.

Organization Units
------------------

 This part of the system displays all organization units (e.g. regions) with options to see all the
 children which fall under a particular organization unit (e.g. districts). On the right hand side of each
 organization unit displayed there are also options to edit and delete a specific organization
 unit.

 An interface for displaying organization units looks as follows:

 .. _fig18:
 .. figure::  _static/organizationunit.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 18: Interface to display Organization Units.**

 If you opt for the down arrow then they get the children of that particular organization unit. In the
 above case, the following will appear

 .. _fig19:
 .. figure::  _static/manageunits.png

 The following is the brief description of the icons displayed in front of each organization unit

Organization Units Groups
-------------------------

 Related organization units can be grouped together to help with the analysis and use of data. With
 this option, one can add as many organization units groups as possible. Example of the
 organization units groups can be hospitals, health centers, dispensaries and others.

 .. _fig21:

 You can edit or delete the details under a specific organization unit group by clicking the
 correct option. Click on the options as the ones shown in the previous section to edit, delete or add
 new organization unit group. See the following screen shots: This screen shot is the same as the
 one to be used in the course of creating a new group

 .. _fig22:
 .. figure::  _static/editorganizationunit.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 22:  Editing organization unit group details.**

Organization Units Groups Sets
------------------------------

 OrgUnit Group Sets are meant to group the groups, again, for analysis and use of data. This part of
 the system is used to create and edit organization unit group sets. The procedure and interfaces
 used are as shown in the figure below:

 .. _fig23:
 .. figure::  _static/addorggroupset.png
    :align:   center

 .. centered:: **fig 23: Creating new organization unit group set.**
